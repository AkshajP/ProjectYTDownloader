## ProjectYTDownloader
This is a simple implementation of PyTube module in a while loop
Features:

 - Download videos in different resolutions
 - Download highest bitrate audio
 - Download multiple of these in just one session
 
 ### Making env and exe
 
 auto-py-to-exe was used to create a console based executable
 environment includes modules:
  - pytube,
  - os,
  - math,
  - time, *(minimally used and better if skipped)*
  - tabulate
  
 ### Future plan :
 
 - Add size of file beside Quality when listing video resolutions (Did in a previous version but code was HORRIBLY slow)
